## Assessments:
Directory listing all the assessments throughout the course.
### [Assessment 1](https://github.com/AllisonBolen/LinearAlgebra/tree/bolen/Assessments/Assessment1):
* Info held in the Assessment 1 sub directory.This sub directory contains the original question document as well as images and answers to those questions. The relevant files will be mentioned in [A1InClass.md](https://github.com/AllisonBolen/LinearAlgebra/blob/bolen/Assessments/Assessment1/A1InClass.md).
#### Reflection on Assessment one:
* This assessment was good for reinforcing the basic ideas of how constraints work and a good way to think visually about LPs. I think I understand the basics fairly well, though the stretch questions I could be wrong about.

### [Assessment 2](https://github.com/AllisonBolen/LinearAlgebra/tree/bolen/Assessments/Assessment2):
* Info held in the Assessment 2 sub directory. Assessment two was about analyzing tableaus and interpreting results of simplex and dual simplex.
#### In Class
* [A2InClass.tex](https://github.com/AllisonBolen/LinearAlgebra/blob/bolen/Assesments/Assesment2/A2InClass.tex) contains my answers for Assessment 2 for the in class portion. The Mathematica files will be referenced within the tex file when applicable.
##### Reflection on A2 in class:
* I enjoyed the assessment, it was interesting to see how you can read these tableaus and what information you can gather from each state of the tableau.
#### Take Home
* [A2TakeHome.tex](https://github.com/AllisonBolen/LinearAlgebra/blob/bolen/Assesments/Assesment2/A2TakeHome.nb) contains my answers and algorithmic steps to solving the take home problems.
##### Reflection on A2 take home:
* Question 2 had me stuck forever, I was having trouble because I forgot that just because something is listed as part of the optimal solution doesn't mean its in the basis. So I made the mistake of putting x1 in the basis with out checking where the slack is left in the LP. Turns out that x2 and x3 had no slack but were supposed to be in the basis and x1 had slack to work with so that meant s1 was in the basis. My mistake was with the original basis set up. I need to work on my problem set up skills more and not my algorithm execution skills.

### [Assessment 3](https://github.com/AllisonBolen/LinearAlgebra/tree/bolen/Assessments/Assessment3)
(It is at this point where I thought it more efficient to produce work than fight with latex compile errors, so answers will now be help in Markdown files.)
This assessment calls for skills dealing with two phase simplex as well as sensitivity analysis.
You can find my answers and Mathematica notebooks in the directory linked above. My written interpretations are in [A3InClass.md](https://github.com/AllisonBolen/LinearAlgebra/blob/bolen/Assessments/Assessment3/A3InClass.md)
#### Reflection
* This assessment is pretty cool. It calls for skills dealing with the two phase simplex method as well as sensitivity analysis. I think I'm pretty good at the sensitivity analysis. I also think two phase is cool, I get that it is used when simplex and dual simplex cant be used, but the transition from phase one to phase two is difficult for me. I'm glad I could get this two phase one solved though, seeing how the transformations correlate to an actual solution is awesome. By far my favorite one. I expressed facility with solution interpretation in this assessment as well as exemplified skills dealing with solving two phase.

### [Assessment 4](https://github.com/AllisonBolen/LinearAlgebra/tree/bolen/Assessments/Assessment4):
Assessment calls for skills dealing with Affine scaling and hessian gradient calculations. It also asks for us to think about and attempt the KKT algorithm.
