# simplex
- Used when you want to find the optimum of a standard form LP.

## steps
- Start at a basic feasible point
  - Choose an entering variable
  - Choose a leaving variable
  - update tableau
  - repeat
- You hit optimum when the objective row of the tableau is all non negative

## Example
You can see an example of the simplex method in the [Pumpkin Spice Problem](https://github.com/AllisonBolen/LinearAlgebra/blob/bolen/simplex/pumpkinspice.nb). This shows facility with simplex as well as sensitivity analysis and shadow pricing.
