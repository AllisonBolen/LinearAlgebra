# Assessment 4

## Question one
See file [A4InClassQ4](https://github.com/AllisonBolen/LinearAlgebra/blob/bolen/Assessments/Assessment4/A4InClassQ4.nb) for multiple steps to for Affine scaling problem. (It kept increasing in size so after like 8 iterations so I just moved on.)
## Question Two
Based off what we discussed in class:
 - A.  Yes
 - B.
 - C.
 - D. Newton: (2.999, -1), Descent: (3.2, -1.09). Supposedly in this case steepest descent is faster than Newtons method. Which is not how it normally is.

## Question Three
  Linear combination of increase is perpendicular to the boundary. In order to be at optimal initial gradient of obj is perpendicular to the boundary.

## Question Four:
  I got nothing for this one.
