### Question 1:
Please see file [A1InClassQ1.nb](https://github.com/AllisonBolen/LinearAlgebra/blob/bolen/Assessments/Assessment1/A1InClassQ1.nb).
### Question 2:
- A: The graph is shown in [A1InClassQ2A.png](https://github.com/AllisonBolen/LinearAlgebra/blob/bolen/Assessments/Assessment1/A1InClassQ2A.png)
- B: The feasible region is unbounded. I can tell because there is no constraint stopping the the vector of [1,1].
- C: The contours can be found in the file [A1InClassQ2C.png](https://github.com/AllisonBolen/LinearAlgebra/blob/bolen/Assessments/Assessment1/A1InClassQ2C.png). The contours are lines where the objective function is the same.
Based on the feasible region and the contours I can see that the LP is unbounded because there is a direction of travel in the
maximization problem that is not bounded.
- D: find and appropriate linear objective function or explain why it would be impossible
  - I. An objective function so that the where the LP has no optimal would be if the constraints were met
but the LP was unbounded: so x1 -3x2 = z this means that the optimum can be ever improving so thus there is no optimum.
  - II. An objective so that the LP is unbounded would be that there is a direction of travel where the
objective function never stops, again like our above example x1-3x2 = z.
  - III. Find an objective function so that the LP has a unique optimal solution.
This is impossible because the constraints will not stop a maximization LP since
it is unbounded in you can always find a larger contour by changing the intercepts of the objective function.
See file A1Q2InClassDIII.png for an example.
  - IV. Find and objective function such that the LP has exactly two optimal solutions.
Impossible because this is not a constrained LP,
there will always be a more optimal solution, so that mean there is only be but we can never reach it.
  - VI. there is not an objective function that would make this LP infeasible because by simply changing the intercepts of the
objective you can reach the feasible region.
